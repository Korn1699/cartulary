#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.7


Getting paid and saving pdfs.


- Bug Fixes
    - JSON river generation would fail sometimes when invalid utf-8 was present (h/t Todd Palmer)
    - Some no-auth pages would fail because showMessage() wasn't in the unauthenticated auth templates
    - Fixed a url in the newuser.opml sub list
    - QR codes weren't being cleaned up from the /tmp folder
    - S3 pref setting bug could potentially lock you out of setting those prefs
    - There were a couple of bugs in the open feed sub code/page

- New Feature: Cartulizing PDF's
    - Cart'ing from urls that point to pdf's now works.  As you can imagine, preserving the structure can be near impossible, but
      sometimes it comes through looking pretty good.  It will improve over time.  For now, at least it's a good way to index the
      content and bring it over to the editor for cleanup.

- New Feature: Paypal button
    - You can now enable a paypal button to show on each user's menu bar and prefs screen.  It is disabled by default.
    - You enable it by setting the "cg_paypal_enabled" option to true in the /opt/cartulary/conf/cartulary.conf file.  Then go and
      create a button on paypal.  Extract the button ID from the generated button code and put it in the variable called cg_paypal_button_id
      which is also located in /opt/cartulary/conf/cartulary.conf
        - cg_paypal_enabled=TRUE
        - cg_paypal_button_id="XGDYD77BWFJG4"
    - Both of these settings are located in the "payments" section of the cartulary.conf file.
    - The paypal button will show up for each user until they click it at least once.  Then it will disappear.
    - The purpose of this is to let your users know that they can donate money to help you cover the costs of running the server.
    - For instance, you could set up a $5/month subscription button.

- Improvements:
    - Carting stories from Reddit will now cart the actual linked-to article and not the reddit thread.
    - This release includes the preliminary node.js code that will take the place of the php feed puller in the next release.
