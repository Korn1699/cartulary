#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.8


More editor work and some security changes.


- There is a new menu option to import external outlines into the current outline.  When you do this, the node with focus
  becomes an "import" node.  An "import" node will not dynamically refresh from the external outline unless you delete all
  of it's children first.  If you have content you want to bring in to your outline, use import.  If you ever want your
  outline to go out and fetch that content again, delete all of the import node's children and then double-click it.  Barring
  that, the content imported is statically part of your outline and won't change.

- Behavior of "include" nodes has changed.  They now dynamically refresh on each collapse-expand.  That means each time you
  collapse, then re-expand an "include" node, the editor fetches a new copy of the external outline.  This is more consistent
  with the way Fargo works, so that people don't find unexpected behavior when switching between the two.  This also enables
  FC to be used as an "instant outliner".

- Better "loading" indicator for ajax operations in the editor.

- There is a new security pref called "Re-prompt for login every time I open the browser."  This toggles your user account
  between 30 day cookies and session cookies.  For those people getting constantly annoyed by having to re-login on mobile, this
  will fix you up.  Convenience vs. security.

- The "reset user" button on the admin panel now clears all user sessions, in light of the new pref above.  If someone loses their
  phone, just do a reset and they will be given a new password and all sessions/tokens will be expired.

- Enter key now submits the form on the login page.  Doh!

- There is a new server level pref in cartulary.conf called "cg_session_hijack_checking".  It's in the [security] section toward
  the bottom of the file.  Set this to 1 to enable strict checking of whether browser agent string and ip have changed between
  session touches.  This gives some moderate protection against session cookie sniffing at the expense of having to re-login more.

- Database updated to version 38.
