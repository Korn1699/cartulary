#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.2


Mostly database and api changes.


- Editor
    - Shortcut change
        - CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+F:  Upload a file into an outline.
        - CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+Enter:  Duplicate the current line above this one.
    - Fixes
        - Search/replace popup now sets focus on the first input upon opening

- Subscribing
    - Subscribing to twitter timelines and searches as feeds
        - To subscribe to someone's twitter timeline, just put the twitter handle, like "@adamcurry", in the subscribe box.
        - For subscribing to a twitter search as a feed, prefix the twitter handle with a plus symbol, like "+@adamcurry", in the subscribe box.

- Search 2.0
    - There is a key in cartulary.conf called "cg_search_v2_enable".  It's "false" by default.  If you set it to "true",
      it will enabled the new search code for river searches.  Please don't enable this feature unless you have PLENTY of
      space on your disk.  It will grow your database size significantly.  Possibly by several gigs.

    - I've aborted the search 2.0 code for now, since there are more important fish to fry.  I'll revisit it at a later date.  It does work though,
      so if you have plenty of disk space and feel frisky you can give it a try.
